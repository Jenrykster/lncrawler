# Not intended for public use

This is a simple web scrapping script to convert some web translated LN pages to epub, it will NOT work on most cases but feel free to fork this and adapt it to your tastes.

Also I'm using this project to learn the basics of C# so don't feel offended by the code quality.

## Tasks
- [ ] Grab all of the chapters/volumes based on an index page.
- [ ] Parse all of the chapters.
- [ ] Compile everything into an epub per volume.
